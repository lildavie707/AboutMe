    <section id="about">
        <h2 class="h2-about">About</h2>
        <p class="h2-about2">David Martin Winstead hails from the small town of Houston, Missouri, where his early years were spent working alongside his father on a large ranch. This experience instilled in him a strong work ethic and a deep connection to his rural roots. As a child, David's life took him to different parts of the Midwest. At the beginning of his 4th grade year, his family relocated to West Plains, Missouri, where he lived until the 7th grade. Another move brought the family to Randolph, Nebraska, before they finally settled in Rolla, Missouri. It was in Rolla that David completed his high school education, graduating from Rolla High School in 1994. <br><br>

            After high school, David pursued higher education, which laid the foundation for a successful 17-year career in sales and marketing. His career path led him to various opportunities, allowing him to hone his skills and build a reputation as a dedicated professional in the field. In 2020, seeking new challenges and experiences, David made a significant move to Medellín, Colombia. There, he took on the role of Director of Marketing for a Canada-based company, where he led innovative marketing strategies and contributed to the company's growth. <br><br>
            
            However, David's journey took another exciting turn in June 2023 when he decided to resign from his position and pursue a new passion: software development. With a keen interest in front-end development, David embarked on a path of learning and self-improvement, driven by a desire to create beautiful websites and innovative applications. His dedication to mastering this new field reflects his continuous pursuit of growth and creativity. <br><br>
            
            Currently, David is engaged to his fiancée, Angélica, and the couple is looking forward to their wedding in November 2024. As he transitions into this new chapter of his life, both personally and professionally, David remains committed to excellence and innovation, embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
